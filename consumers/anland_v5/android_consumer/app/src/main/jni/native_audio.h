/*
 * Consumer-side audio bridge over the display library's audio socket.
 *
 *   - playback: reads desktop PCM datagrams from the socket and writes them to an
 *                AAudio output stream (the Android speaker);
 *   - capture : reads the Android mic via an AAudio input stream and writes PCM
 *                datagrams to the socket (the producer exposes them as a Linux
 *                recording source). Only active while the mic is enabled.
 *
 * The playback AAudio stream stays open and is driven by an AAudio callback. The
 * socket thread appends PCM into a small ring buffer; the callback outputs an
 * inaudible keepalive when Linux is idle. This keeps Android's mixer awake across
 * short UI sounds without reconnecting the display pipeline. The capture stream is
 * opened once and only started while the mic is enabled. The active display_ctx
 * (and thus the live audio fd) is swapped via audio_set_ctx(). The audio fd is
 * owned by the display library -- never closed here.
 *
 * The bridge is per-instance: each consumer window owns its own audio_bridge (its
 * own AAudio playback + capture streams, connected to its own producer). Multiple
 * playback streams are mixed by AudioFlinger, so every window's desktop audio is
 * audible regardless of focus; the capture streams share the single physical mic.
